# <MyPorfolio>

## Description

My motivation is to create a webpage that contain mini projects that I had done throughout my web development pratices. 

I build this project, because this portfolio will be used to support me in my web development employment in the future.

The problem it solves is that it would contain links to project that will help me show my web development skills.

I've learned a lot about flexbox and its usefulness. I strongly think that flexbox conflicts with inline and block properties, but it should be used as a required format for web developers.
